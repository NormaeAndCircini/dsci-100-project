    "the `metrics` function from the `tidymodels` package can help us. To get the statistics about the quality of our model, you need to specify the `truth` and `estimate` arguments. If we had to improve our classifier, we have to change the parameter: number of neighbours, $K$. Since cross-validation helps us evaluate the accuracy of our classifier, we can use cross-validation to calculate an accuracy for each value of $K$ in a reasonable range, and then pick the value of $K$ that gives us the best accuracy. The great thing about the `tidymodels` package is that it provides a very simple syntax for tuning models. Using `tune()`, each parameter in the model can be adjusted rather than given a specific value. \n",
